DiamondOps provides a documentation-first technical authority layer that validates
the correctness of retrofit and operational configurations where regulatory
requirements, hardware constraints, and operational intent intersect.

DiamondOps does not manufacture, install, operate, maintain, or control physical
equipment, and does not assume operational duty of care or responsibility for
real-world performance.

DiamondOps outputs structured documentation, schemas, and validation artifacts
only, and provides no physical, operational, or enforcement services.
