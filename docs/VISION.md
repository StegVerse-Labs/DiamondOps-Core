# DiamondOps Vision

DiamondOps is the operations and infrastructure layer for synthetic crystal manufacturing.

It provides:
- Safety + permitting primitives (HydraSafe)
- Asset lifecycle + retrofit operations (ReactorOps)
- Process intelligence and yield tracking (YieldOS)
- Controlled experimental frontier (CrystalWorks)

DiamondOps is not a diamond seller. It is a platform for safety, compliance, operational excellence, and survivability under price compression.
