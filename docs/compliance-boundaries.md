# Compliance Boundaries

DiamondOps documentation is intended for lawful industrial safety, operations, and analytics.

It does NOT:
- provide instructions to bypass safety systems
- provide guidance for unlawful activity
- provide step-by-step instructions for constructing hazardous industrial systems without qualified professionals

HydraSafe deliverables emphasize compliance checklists, permitting packets, and auditability.
